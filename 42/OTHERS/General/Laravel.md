# Setup, Commands and Artisan
- After setting up PHP and Composer:
```
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

cd example-app
php artisan serve //launches local development server 
```

## Artisan ('' = php artisan)
- '' make:controller {ControllerName}
- '' make:model {ModelName}
- '' make:migration {MigrationName}
- '' make:middleware {MiddlewareName}
- '' serve
- '' list (available artisan commands)
- '' help {command} (eg: php artisan help make:controller, will give u guide)

```
- **vendor** - generated from composer.json with composer install. Very similar to node_modules folder generated by package.json file with npm install in Node JS.
- **resources** - all user views, basically frontend of the web app, source code is still private whereas iin public folder the source code can be seen by end users.
- **routes/web.php** - usually contains all routes

# MVC model
### Model
- represents data structure, includes Eloquent ORM relationships & methods for data manipulation
- sometimes uses a repository pattern for extra abstraction
- **Software Design Principles**
	- **SRP** (Single Responsibility Principle) - only handles related data type
	- **OCP** (Open/Close Principle) - open for extension, closed for modification
- **Design Patterns**
	- **Repository Pattern**
	- **Active Record Pattern** - ties database records into code data objects, an interactive representation of the database entry
- **Best Practices**
	- Fat Models, Skinny controllers
	- Validation in Models

## View
- appearance of the program
- focuses on displaying information to the user
- **Software Design Principles**
	- **SOC** (Separation of Concerns) - 
	- **DIP** (Dependency Inversion Principle) - 
- **Design Patterns**
	- **Template Method Pattern**
- **Best Practices**
	- Avoid logic in views
	- Use view composers

## Controller
- controls the interaction between the view and the model
- middle man basically
- handles user actions, interprets them, and triggers appropriate operations in Model
- updates the view to reflect for any changes with the application state
- - **Software Design Principles**
	- **SRP** (Single Responsibility Principle) - only handles related data type
	- **DI** (Dependency Injection) - 
- **Design Patterns**
	- **Command Pattern**
- **Best Practices**
	- Thin controllers
	- Request Validation 


## Naming Convention for MVC
| REQUEST | Route | Controller & Action | View |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| GET | /home | HomeController@index | index |
| GET | /home/{id} | HomeController@show | show |
| GET | /home/create | HomeController@create | create |

# Index
### Abstraction
- encapsulating something complex into something simple. (eg: You dont need to know how does the programming of a controller movement button works, you just need to know that they move your character)
- higher-level concept that hides the complex details.

### Eloquent ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
- For "ORM", imagine theres a spreadsheet, then theres a description of the items in that spreadsheet but written in code, ORM is the translator for them. In the context of Laravel, ORM helps databases and object models in OOP to understand each other, thus "mapping".
- The term "Eloquent" means to speak or write in a fluent, persuasive, and expressive manner
- In the context of Laravel, the name suggests that developers can communicate with database using a syntax that is readable, expressive, and efficient.

### Repository Pattern
- Imagine a library `(database)`, repository `(librarian)`, books `(data objects)`. Basically the librarian will handle where the books are placed and how its sorted. So at the same time itll also know where to get it, and specifically how to get it. Repository does all the CRUD
- A librarian `(repository)`, will have a set of guidelines `(implementation)` to follow. These implementations ensure that the librarians always follow SOP to do CRUD operations on their library `(database)`, each librarian `(repository)` will focus on their own book genre.
- In a way, the implementation is basically abstracting the methods to interact with the data objects. The abstracted methods will just be the **interface**, like the movement buttons of a controller.
- Purpose: to decouple (make them independent) from one another.

### Interface Segregation
- Encouraged to create an interface repository based on specific use cases, promoting a more modular and adaptable codebase, so it when creating a new implementation, it wont affect others.

### Providers
