| **Storage Type**       | **Where It Is?**   | **Access Speed**                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Registers**          | Inside the CPU     | 🔥 **Fastest** (a few CPU cycles)            |
| **Cache (L1, L2, L3)** | Near the CPU       | ⚡ Very fast (slightly slower than registers) |
| **RAM (Main Memory)**  | On the motherboard | 🐌 Much slower (~100x slower than registers) |

🚀 **Why?**  
1️⃣ **Registers are directly connected to the CPU**—no need to fetch data from RAM.  
2️⃣ **No bus latency**—RAM sits on a motherboard and communicates via a memory bus, which takes time.  
3️⃣ **No memory addressing overhead**—RAM requires address lookup, but registers are directly referenced.  
4️⃣ **Registers are built with ultra-fast SRAM** (Static RAM), while main memory uses slower **DRAM** (Dynamic RAM).
