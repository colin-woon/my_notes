# 1. Unit Testing
- tests units of code, ensuring their functionality
- **Best Practice -** Adopt a TDD approach, where tests are written before the actual code. Utilize testing frameworks to streamline unit testing (Jest for Javascript/Typescript, PHPUnit for PHP)
# 2. Integration Testing
- checks on how different components work together in a system
- **Best Practice -** Design clear interfaces between components, use tools like Supertest for Node.js, Postman for API. Implement continuous integration to run integration tests automatically with each code change. (Nodemon for Node.js)
# 3. System Testing
- tests the completed system, includes all components functional and non-functional.
- **Best Practice -** Create comprehensive test scenarios, covering user interactions and system functionalities. (Selenium for web application system, XCTest for iOS)

# 4. Regression Testing
- tests for new code changes to ensure existing functionalities still work. Prevents reintroduction of bugs as the new codebase evolves
- **Best Practice -** Automate the test to quickly validate the codebase with each release.

# 5. User Acceptance Testing
- validates the software against user requirements. Ensures software meets end-user requirements and is ready for deployment
- **Best Practice -** Collaborate closely with stakeholders during UAT to gather feedback. Use real-world scenarios to stimulate user interactions.

# 6. Performance Testing
- assess software responsiveness, scalability, and stability under various conditions. Ensures application can handle expected loads, and identify any performance bottlenecks.
- **Best Practice -** Apache JMeter, k6, to simulate different level of user traffic. Monitor system resources during testing and optimize performance based on results.

# 7. Security Testing
- assess software security, ensuring that malicious users cannot exploit software components
- **Best Practice -** Conduct regular security audits, OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for web application security testing, stay informed about latest security threats and best practices

# 8. End-to-end Testing
- verifies the entire application workflow, checking if all components work together as expected. 
- **Best Practice -** Employ frameworks like Cypress for web apps for Selenium for cross-browser testing. Focus the test on critical user journeys.
