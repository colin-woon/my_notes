# a. Types of partitions
- **Primary:** The only partition on which an OS can be installed. There can only be 4 primary partitions per hard drive or 3 primary and one extended.

- **Secondary/Extended:** It was designed to break the 4 primary partition limitation on a single physical disk. There can only be one partition of this type per disk, and it only serves to contain logical partitions.

-  **Logical:** It occupies a portion of the primary/extended partition or the whole of it, which has been formatted with a specific type of file system (in our case we will use ext4) and has been assigned a unit, so the operating system recognizes the logical partitions or its file system. There can be a maximum of 23 logical partitions in an extended partition, however, Linux, the OS we are currently working with, reduces it to 15, more than enough for this project.

	- server-side
	- how ssh server accepts and manages connections
- **ssh_config**
	- client-side
	- how client connects to server
## SSH related commands

	- vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	- uncomment and change port 22 to port 4242
	- sudo service ssh restart
```
# d. UFW
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** - A simple firewall that uses command line to set up iptables
	- **iptables** - user-space utility program that allows system administrator to configure IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall, implemented as different **Netfilter** modules 
- **Firewall** - network security system that controls ingoing and outgoing network traffic based on a predetermined security rules, utilizes netfilter
- **Netfilter** *(more low-level than firewall, does the heavy lifting of actually processing network packets)*- a framework by linux that allows various networking operations *(eg: packet filtering, network address translation (NAT))* to be implemented in the form of customized handlers 
## UFW related commands
```
sudo apt install ufw - installs ufw
sudo ufw enable - enable ufw on startup
sudo ufw allow <port-number> - allows port connection
sudo ufw status {verbose/numbered} - checks ufw status
```

```
Installation:
	- sudo apt install ufw
	- sudo ufw enable
	- sudo ufw allow 4242
	- sudo ufw {status/status verbose/status numbered}
```

# e. Sudo policies
```
Configuration:
	- touch /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
	- mkdir /var/log/sudo
	- vim /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
		- Defaults  passwd_tries=3
		- Defaults  badpass_message="Password is incorrect ya dingus"
		- Defaults  logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo_config"
		- Defaults  log_input, log_output (what will be logged)
		- Defaults  iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo" (I/O log directory)
		- Defaults  requiretty (requires terminal)
		- Defaults  secure_path = "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin" (folders that excludes sudo)
```

	- vim /etc/login.defs
		➤ PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 -> 30 (max days till pwd expires)
		➤ PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 -> 2 (min days till pwd change)

# Eval Questions
### What is a Virtual Machine
- An emulation of a physical computer, you have the flexibility to allocate resources to it such as CPU core, memory (RAM), storage and network resources from the host machine to the VM
### DebianOS vs CentOS
- more lightweight
- more community support
- easier to setup
- large repository (more packages compared to CentOS)
### Difference between aptitude and apt
- apt more straightforward, aptitude will have a text interface as it is more robust
- basic logging vs detailed logging
- simple dependency handling vs advanced dependency resolution
	- (example if packageA depends on packageB and their versions are incompatible, apt needs manual resolution whereas aptitude will give prompts to update/downgrade the packageB version and automatically resolve it for you)
	- if removing packages, it will work in a similar fashion where if packageA depends on packageC and was installed together, aptitude remove will auto remove both packageA and packageC together
### APPArmor (Application armor)
- Linux security module, enforces mandatory access control policies on individual applications
- controls access to files, directories, network resources, and other system objects. Profiles can allow or deny access to specific paths, restrict network operations, and limit the use of certain system capabilities.
- similar to chmod but auto configured for individual applications

### What is LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
refer to [[#a. Types of partitions]]

### What is UFW
refer to [[#d. UFW]]
### What is SSH
- Secure Shell, is a network protocol used to securely access and manage remote computers over a network. It provides a secure channel for communication between two networked devices, typically a client and a server
### What is Cron
- time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It allows users to schedule scripts, commands, or programs to run automatically at specified intervals
- useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as backups, system maintenance, or sending emails.
- To stop cron:
```
	sudo systemctl stop cron
	sudo systemctl start cron
	sudo crontab -u root -e

	sudo systemctl disable cron (disables it even if vm reboots)
	sudo systemctl enable cron
	sudo systemctl start cron
```

### Bonus
